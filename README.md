# About Me
In this project, we will be working with variables and understanding the different data types

## Objective
Declare variables, assign values to the variables, and console.log variables.

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project students must have the following:<br>
- Basic understanding of Github forking and cloning.
- Be able to link `html` and `js` file

## Requirements
To complete this project you will need the following:
- Google Chrome browser
- Chrome Developer tools
- Sublime Text

## Desired Outcome
At the completion of this exercise, students should understand:
- Better understanding of Variables and Data Types

## Your Challenge
1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** this repository from your personal Github account:
    - Copy HTTP address on the page.
    - In your **webdev** folder on your **desktop**, run the command `git clone [insert the github http url address copied from github]` in order to clone that repository into your folder.
3. Navigate into the about-me folder by using the command `cd my-pokedex`
4. Open about-me folder in your **Sublime Text Editor** by selecting **File** then **Open Folder**
5. Create `index.html` file and link to `aboutme.js`
6. Create sanity check
  - Type **console.log('hello world')** in `aboutme.js`
  - Go to `index.html` and right click **open in browser**
  - When the Chrome browser opens, right click then click **inspect**
  - Click on the **console** tab, `"Hello World"` should show up
5. You will be following instructions and writing your code in the `aboutme.js` file
6. After you complete and save the first instruction, refresh your browser to see your new console.log
